# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview and Analysis
The objective of this project is to help Pewlett-Hackard to determine how many employees are going to retire in the near future, so they can prepare the company for that. This will help the company to know how many positions do they need to fill, in order to keep running as usual. Also, it would be very helpful to determine the employees that have enough experience to mentor the new employees entering Pewlett-Hackard. 

### Results
With the analysis made with SQL, we got several results that tell us about the needs that Pewlett-Hackard needs to satisfy: 
- There are 72,458 employees that are going to retire from Pewlett-Hackard.

- One of the employees in the mentor program, has to mentor around 47 new employees. 

### Summary 
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? The company will need to fill 72,458 new roles. 
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? I would say that no. For one mentor there would be more than 46 new employees.
